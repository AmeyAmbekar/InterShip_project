🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis

Dive into the world of hotel bookings! This project explores patterns and insights hidden within the Data_Train dataset, revealing how travelers behave, where they come from, and what influences their decisions. Whether you're a curious analyst or a business strategist, this analysis has something for you.


📌 Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook delves into hotel booking behaviors using Python’s data analysis tools. It addresses key questions such as:

Which countries generate the most hotel bookings?

Which room types drive the highest revenue?

How do booking conditions affect cancellation rates?

What are the monthly trends in the Average Daily Rate (ADR)?

Using rich visualizations and data transformations, this project uncovers actionable insights for hotel managers, marketers, and analysts.


🧠 Key Features


🔍 Data Cleaning

Managed missing values

Filtered out irrelevant entries (e.g., bookings with zero guests)


📊 Visual Analytics

Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Folium to generate:

Box plots for ADR across room types

Choropleth maps to visualize guest origins
